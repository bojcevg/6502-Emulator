# *WIP* 6502-Emulator - Project that is to emulate the functionality of the classic 6502 CPU
## This project is being made by following the video series "NES Emulator" by [OneLoneCoder](https://OneLoneCoder.com), you can also find the license [HERE](./LICENSE)

### Motivation

I embarked on this project to deepen my understanding of low-level computing and processor architecture, particularly the 6502 CPU, which is foundational to many classic computing systems. By building an emulator, I aimed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, improving my skills in problem-solving, debugging, and writing efficient code.

This project also allowed me to explore how real hardware operates at the instruction level, offering insights into optimization, memory management, and the fundamental principles of software development. I chose the 6502 for its historical significance and its simplicity, making it an ideal starting point for diving into emulation and systems programming.

Through this journey, Iâ€™ve honed my ability to read technical documentation, implement algorithms, and write clean, maintainable code. It reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my curiosity for the inner workings of technology, skills that I believe are directly transferable to solving complex challenges in any software development role.
